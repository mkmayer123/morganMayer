Directions to using my GUI plot:
When you first run the program, an empty plot will appear. On the right and left sides, there will be options to change the shape and color of the plot points. You can enter your own x and y values as well as a plot title and axises titles. The program will run even if you decide to leave these blank. You can also reset the plot by pressing 'reset'.
When you are ready to plot your point, click 'plot' and they should appear. If you decide to change the shape or color, select your choice and click 'plot' again to refresh.
When inputing x and y values, separate each number with a comma. Brackets and spaces are not mandatory, but won't hurt if you do choose to include them.
  Example input: X-values = 1,2,3  Y-values = 2,4,6.
The x and y values need to be the same length or else you will receive an error that the vectors are not the same length and will need to enter values with the same length.
