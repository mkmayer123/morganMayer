Directions to using my GUI plot:
When you first run the program, an empty plot will appear. On the right and left sides, there will be options to change the shape and color of the plot points (Ex: red o OR blue --). The shape o is for dots, * is for stars, and -- is for a dashed line.
You can enter your own x and y values as well as a plot title and axises titles. When inputing x and y values, separate each number with a comma. Brackets and spaces are not mandatory, but won't hurt if you do choose to include them.
  Example input: X-values = 1,2,3  Y-values = 2,4,6.
The x and y values need to be the same length or else you will receive an error.
When entering upper and lower limits, make sure to include two numbers with a comma separating them.
When you are ready to plot your point, click 'plot' and they should appear. If you decide to change the shape or color, select your choice and click 'plot' again to refresh.
The program will still run even if you decide to leave some of these blank. You can reset the plot by pressing 'reset'.
