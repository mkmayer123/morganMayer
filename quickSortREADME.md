quickSort
Q1. It is necessary to put base case at the beginning of a recursive function because it is a way to return without having to make a recursive call. The base case is like a stop sign that is necessary for a recursive algorithm so it knows when to end otherwise it will loop forever which would be bad.
Q2. The potential pitfalls one can encounter if a recursive algotrithm is not implented correctly are the base case is missing so the loop goes on forever and ever or the larger problem does not split into a smaller probelm so the recursion never converges.
Q3. Three types of problems that can be solved with a divide and conquer strategy are quicksort, binary searching, and merge sort.
