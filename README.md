# Q1
1. While loops run the same code over and over until it meets a specific condition. For loops is used when the number of integrations is known beforehand. You would use a while loop if you took 26 and wanted to know how many times you could divide it to get to zero. Another example would be calculating the area of a circle.
# Q2
The if/elseif/else is used when you are selecting between two alternatives. If you have multiple alternatives, then you would use a switch/case statement.
# Q3
Else doesn't need a conditional statement because the purpose of the else statement is to execute alternative code in the case where if/elseif conditions return false.
