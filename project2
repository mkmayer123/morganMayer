Instructions:
1. Given the parameters and variables.
2. Input given equations.
3. Label plot and axis.
4. For the meshgrid, use the given variables to plug into acceleration and endurance equations.
5. Use given endurance and acceleration equations to plug in the plot. For the Z axis, use the relationship between endurance and acceleration using E.*a.
6. Once you've calculated the X,Y,Z, use the surface function to plot the values on the meshgrid.
